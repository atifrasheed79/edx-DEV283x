*DEV283x Module 1 Assignment*

1) Decided to csvtojson module, read documentation at https://www.npmjs.com/package/csvtojson
2) Created a repo on github, initialized a local repo.
3) Installed the module. (#npm i csv2json).
4) Downloaded the csv file.
5) Added csv file and modules directory to the repository.
6) Used csvtojson module sample code to convert CSV to JSON
7) Finally used one of my previous practice files (write a stream to file), to write the JSON objects to a file.

*Problems*
It took some time to realize how to write data (JSON objects) to a file. Finally appendFileSync did the trick for me. I am still struggling with synchronous and asynchronous operations.
